        Context is a full-stack, cloud-based web application designed to help users 
        write, compile, and collaborate on code in real-time. Built with React and Firebase, CCE 
        enables multiple users to work together on shared documents with live editing and persistent 
        storage. Each document supports versioning, custom titles, user-based access controls, and 
        the ability to invite collaborators via secure email links. <br></br> <br></br>

        The backend leverages firebase authentication for secure login with google accounts, and cloud 
        firestore for real-time document management and permission handling. Users can create, edit, 
        and delete documents, while collaborators can contribute without compromising data integrity, due 
        to structured security rules. <br></br> <br></br>

        The interface includes features like document history management, downloadable files, and a 
        compiler pane. For code execution, CCE integrates with the Judge0 API, allowing users to compile and 
        run C, Java, and Python code directly from the browser. <br></br> <br></br>

        Whether you're a student, instructor, or developer, Context has the potential to offer a reliable 
        environment for coding and collaboration from any device.
